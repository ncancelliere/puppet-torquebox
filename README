Overview

This module will install Torquebox along with its supplied JRuby. It's been
tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise).


Example Use

Simply include this module in your node, that's it!

node 'my.node.com' {
  include torquebox
}

You'll find the installation at /opt/torquebox/current.  It also adds an
upstart script so you can use 'start torquebox' or 'stop torquebox' to control
the server. Environment variables are kept in /etc/profile.d/torquebox.sh.

This module does not install any proxies (such as Apache Proxy). If you wish 
to proxy your web apps you are free to do so, you'll just need to add the 
appropriate module to your node and configure.


About Torquebox

TorqueBox is a new kind of Ruby application platform that integrates popular 
technologies such as Ruby on Rails, while extending the footprint of Ruby 
applications to include built-in support for services such as messaging, 
scheduling, and daemons.

TorqueBox provides an all-in-one environment, built upon the latest, most 
powerful JBoss AS Java application server. Functionality such as clustering, 
load-balancing and high-availability is included right out-of-the-box.
